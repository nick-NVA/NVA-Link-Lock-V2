# Simple URL Locker (Client-Side)

This is a basic static website that allows you to create a "locked" URL. You provide a target website URL and a PIN. It generates a new link. When someone visits this new link, they must enter the correct PIN to be redirected to the original target URL.

5.  Copy the generated URL and send it to someone.
6.  When they visit the link, they will be prompted to enter the PIN on the `lock.html` page to proceed.
